        math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can''t do any
        complex calculations that a human could not do in their head. You also have
        an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.\n\nSo
        we hooked you up to a Ruby 3 kernel, and now you can execute ruby code. If
        anyone gives you a hard math problem, just use this format and weâ€™ll take
        care of the rest:\n\nQuestion: ${{Question with hard calculation.}}\n```ruby\n${{Code
        that prints what you need to know}}\n```\n\nOtherwise, use this simpler format:\n\nQuestion:
        ${{Question without hard calculation}}\nAnswer: ${{Answer}}\n\nBegin.\n\nQuestion:
        What is 37593 * 67?\n```ruby\nputs(37593 * 67)\n```\n\nQuestion: what is 2518731
