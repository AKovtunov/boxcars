        he wishes to obtain, always limit your query\nto at most 5 results using a

        from a specific table, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.\n\nPay
        attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema description.
        Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist.\nAlso, pay attention
        to which column is in which table.\n\nUse the following format:\nQuestion:

        the SQLQuery\"\nAnswer: \"Final answer here\"\n\nOnly use the following tables:\nCREATE
